				<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>

				<p>
					This is a device that prints postcards from your current location. Enabling the user to create a physical album that stimulates memory, tells a story and inspires adventure.
					<br>
					<br>
					In this project I sought to explore the question: is it possible for us to untether ourselves from our devices in a way that also allows us to remember life’s special moments?

			Everyone knows the dusty cabinet where your old family photos are. Or the junk drawer filled with a lifetime worth or artifacts. Looking through these places are like portals to different times of your life. You don’t just remember sitting next to your Aunt Jill in the living room in that photo. You remember what you were doing that day, what the room looked like, what that time of your life felt like. These memories bleed beyond what the ink on the page has presented. In expanding on this question I built Breadcrumbs. It's a type of instant camera that uses your location to tell a story of where you’ve been through printed receipts. These receipts are a sort of postcard from the present to help remind you, or anyone who may discover them where you have been and done; or perhaps where you're off to next. These postcards offer a different glimpse of the user's memories. By recording and synthesizing location data via an arduino, gps chip, sd card and a hacked heat. printer you are left with a new kind of instant photo.

			Using breadcrumbs is simple. You don't even need to focus. Just turn it on, wait for the green light then press the button. While there is still plenty to do in perfecting the device, much went into what has brought breadcrumbs to its current form. If this project has taught me anything it is that prototyping fast and often, and reading the data sheet is the true way to happiness. Starting on the breadboard tweaking components and the code are what allowed me to focus later on designing and creating an enclosure that complemented the device's features to give it a true product feel.

			Combining an ordinary guitar with an arduino and accelerometer unlocks a whole new world of musical possibilities to the user. Building ways for these components to interact with programs such as Max allow the programmer to run their computer between the guitar and amp as the ultimate effects pedal. In the guitars current mode it is configured to create lush soundscapes. The X and Y axis of the accelerometer manipulate parameters of a long echo. In addition, on board potentiometers and a custom footswitch give the player access to infinite looping capabilities as well as control over volume, wet/dry signal of guitar / loop tracks, and backing track control.
